# Trynext Lifestyle — Agent Handoff

This is the durable, shareable context for the Trynext Lifestyle project. Read it
after `AGENTS.md` and before planning or editing. Keep it updated after meaningful
work. Never put secret values in this file.

## Project identity

Trynext Lifestyle is a Bangladesh-focused print-on-demand commerce platform for
custom T-shirts, hoodies, mugs, caps, long sleeves, and water bottles. It includes
a customer storefront, browser Design Studio, admin back office, API server,
mobile app, promotional experience, and brand-system artifact.

## Read-first files

1. `AGENTS.md` — mandatory Agent operating rules
2. `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this durable project context
3. `replit.md` — architecture, workflows, product behavior, and gotchas
4. The relevant current source files and tests for the user's request

## Current product surfaces

- Customer storefront and admin panel: `artifacts/trynex-storefront`
- API server: `artifacts/api-server`
- Mobile app: `artifacts/trynext-mobile`
- Promo experience: `artifacts/trynext-promo`
- Brand system: `artifacts/trynext-brand-system`
- Shared API contract and generated clients: `lib/api-spec`, `lib/api-client-react`,
  and `lib/api-zod`
- Database schema and migrations: `lib/db`

## Existing work to preserve

- The storefront is the public Trynext Lifestyle commerce experience.
- The Design Studio supports precise 2D editing and realistic 3D/final rendering.
- Curved products use the 3D preview by default while flat apparel uses the 2D
  view by default.
- Product switching re-fits artwork to the target product's print zone.
- Shipping, payment, customer contact, admin settings, and other customer-facing
  values are settings-driven where documented in `replit.md` and memory.
- The API server is compiled before restart; editing API source alone does not
  hot-reload the running server.
- Existing authentication, admin session, database failover, backup, storage,
  rate limiting, and security behavior must be preserved unless the user
  explicitly requests a change.

## Working protocol for every new request

1. Read the current user request and identify the exact requested outcome.
2. Read the first-priority files listed above.
3. Inspect the relevant current implementation; do not rely only on this summary.
4. In the first response, confirm the three required files were read and clearly
   report completed work, the previous stopping point, remaining work, blockers,
   the proposed plan, preserved behavior, verification, and safe parallel work.
5. Submit a plan before editing.
6. Identify all related paths, including API/client, desktop/mobile, admin/customer,
   persisted/runtime, and old/new or before/after behavior.
7. Implement only the approved scope.
8. If independent work is parallelized, reconcile it before completion.
9. Run the relevant verification, rebuilding/restarting services when required.
10. Update this file with durable results, decisions, and remaining work.
11. Submit a completion note before closing or a status handoff when pausing,
    blocking, or transferring the work.

## Current open work

### Storefront performance checkpoint (2026-09-16)

```text
Status: ready for review — local performance release verified
Last completed: Reduced home catalog work to a bounded no-count request, added a
process-local product cache, extended safe catalog edge caching with stale-while-
revalidate, prioritized the first home product image, and generated 90 small WebP
product thumbnails from the large PNG masters.
Stopped at: After rebuilding/restarting both managed workflows, measuring cold and
warm API responses, checking thumbnail responses, running the storefront tests,
and capturing a clean desktop preview.
Files/areas changed: API product list route and client hook, storefront image URL
resolution and home product loading, Cloudflare Pages API cache headers, and
public/assets/products/optimized/*.webp.
Remaining work: Publish the verified source and optimized assets only after a
valid GitHub remote credential/repository URL is available. Cloudflare provider
verification remains separate and was not mutated.
Blocker: This checkout has no configured git origin; the newly available GitHub
credential returned repository-not-found when tested against the historical
repository path. Do not force-push or guess a repository URL.
Next safe action: Confirm the canonical GitHub repository through secure workspace
integration/configuration, then fetch main, merge normally, run the release checks,
and publish through the connected Pages workflow.
Verification: API and storefront typechecks passed; storefront production build
passed; API build passed; all 19 storefront test files and 69 tests passed; 33 of
36 API tests passed, with the 3 failures limited to absent excluded PSD/PSB fixture
files; API products returned 200 with includeTotal=false in about 0.55s cold and
about 0.003s from the local cache; generated WebP thumbnails returned 200 at
35–80KB; both workflows are running; desktop preview rendered without browser
console errors; git diff checks passed.
```

### GitHub restore checkpoint (2026-09-16)

```text
Status: complete — verified functional application restore pushed
Last completed: Preserved the previous remote main in
  backup-before-local-restore-5c1b07d93, then published the verified local
  application checkpoint to the canonical GitHub main as a clean restore commit.
Stopped at: After restarting both managed workflows and confirming local API,
  storefront, Design Studio, products, and GitHub ref smoke checks.
Files/areas changed: GitHub main ref, the restore handoff, and the functional
  source/runtime tree. The local-only dist-mockups masters/archives/packages,
  attached_assets inputs, agent/tool caches, screenshots, audit evidence, and
  verification reports were intentionally excluded from the GitHub restore tree
  because they expanded the local tree to about 4.8 GB and are not runtime
  application inputs.
Remaining work: None for the functional source restore. Cloudflare provider
  verification remains a separate task because the stored provider token was
  previously rejected with HTTP 401.
Blocker: None for GitHub restore or local operation. Redis is unavailable in the
  local environment, but DB-backed API readiness is healthy and the documented
  fallback is active.
Next safe action: If the excluded editable masters or source inputs must be
  published, place them in reviewed object storage or a separately approved
  artifact release rather than force-pushing the multi-gigabyte workspace tree.
Verification: GitHub main points to db5d13e2 and the backup branch points to the
  prior remote main; local API liveness/readiness and products returned 200;
  storefront and Design Studio returned 200; both workflows are running; and
  git diff checks passed. No database, order, payment, or Cloudflare data changed.
```

### Full Trynext rename local-validation checkpoint (2026-09-08)

```text
Status: locally complete — approved rename validated without provider mutation
Last completed: Corrected the remaining gateway read-origin rename, reconciled the
  workspace lockfile/package links, rebuilt the API and storefront, restarted both
  managed workflows, and completed local API/storefront smoke verification.
Stopped at: After confirming the renamed storefront renders, the API is DB-ready,
  and all local validation gates pass. Cloudflare was intentionally not touched.
Files/areas changed: gateway-config.ts copies, approved rename documentation
  whitespace, workspace lockfile reconciliation, and this handoff.
Remaining work: Provider-side Cloudflare verification or mutation is still separate
  and should only happen after the secure Cloudflare token is corrected. Historical
  attachments/backups were intentionally not rewritten.
Blocker: The stored CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN previously returned HTTP 401 "Invalid API
  Token", so account/Pages verification and any Cloudflare change remain blocked.
Next safe action: Replace the Cloudflare token through secure secret management,
  verify token/account access, then perform only the approved non-destructive
  Cloudflare inspection before considering a provider rollout.
Verification: storefront typecheck/build passed; API typecheck/build passed; root
  workspace typecheck passed; storefront tests passed (19 files, 67 tests); API
  tests passed (10 files, 36 tests); Smart matrix validation passed (188 surfaces
  and 1,128 runtime roles); Smart Object release validation passed; frozen
  lockfile install passed; API liveness/readiness and products smoke checks
  returned 200; storefront root and Design Studio routes returned 200; both
  managed workflows are running; desktop preview rendered without browser-console
  errors; malformed-token scan and git diff checks passed. No Cloudflare, order,
  payment, or production data changed.
```

### Latest Cloudflare credential and configuration checkpoint (2026-09-08)

```text
Status: partially complete — repository configuration fixed; provider API blocked
Last completed: Verified the securely stored CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN against the
  Cloudflare token-verification and account endpoints, then corrected wrangler.toml
  from an obsolete Workers-style configuration to the active Cloudflare Pages
  configuration used by trynext-lifestyle-shop.
Stopped at: Cloudflare returned HTTP 401 "Invalid API Token" before permissions
  could be evaluated, so no direct Cloudflare account, Pages, or Workers mutation
  was attempted.
Files/areas changed: wrangler.toml and this handoff only.
Remaining work: Re-run Cloudflare API verification after the secure secret contains
  a valid account token, then inspect or repair the separate legacy Workers Build
  project if it is still required. GitHub-connected Pages remains the verified
  deployment path.
Blocker: The current stored Cloudflare token is rejected at authentication time.
Next safe action: Update the CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN secret through secure secret
  management, then verify `user/tokens/verify` and account access before any
  provider mutation.
Verification: storefront typecheck/build, API typecheck, 188-surface mockup
  validation, 1,128-role validation, and git diff checks passed after the
  configuration correction. No production data changed.
```

### Latest GitHub and Cloudflare rollout checkpoint (2026-09-08)

```text
Status: complete — verified source push and Cloudflare Pages rollout
Last completed: Merged GitHub main normally without force-pushing, corrected the
  Smart Object release validator to default to the active smart-v10-v3 staging tree,
  pushed the verified continuation, and waited for the connected Pages build.
Stopped at: The public Pages deployment is serving the pushed Smart v10.3 runtime
  and the lazy Design Studio chunk with the new upload/image-tools implementation.
Files/areas changed: tools/validate-smartobject-release.mjs and this handoff only
  after the reviewed merge; no order, payment, or production data changed.
Remaining work: None for the requested storefront, Design Studio, mockup matrix,
  GitHub publication, or Cloudflare Pages rollout.
Blocker: Direct Cloudflare API management remains unavailable because the configured
  provider token returns 401. A separate legacy Cloudflare Workers Builds check
  reported failure, while the requested Cloudflare Pages check completed successfully;
  investigate that separate workflow before relying on it for future releases.
Next safe action: If provider automation is needed, replace the Cloudflare API secret
  with an Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit token and separately inspect the failed
  Workers check. Do not reuse the exposed historical R2 credentials.
Verification: `node tools/validate-smartobject-release.mjs` passed structurally
  verified 188/188; active matrix and runtime-role validation passed 188/188 and
  1,128/1,128; storefront typecheck, 19 test files/67 tests, production build, and
  API typecheck passed; the real Playwright flow passed product/cart/checkout/Studio
  checks plus upload → visible artwork → image tools → crop/extend on desktop and
  mobile; the mobile sticky purchase dock remained visible. Live `/api/mockups`
  returned 188 Smart v10.3 rows, all 188 API-derived runtime PNG URLs returned
  200, representative retired paths returned 410, the deployed Studio chunk
  contained `smart-v10.3`, `Crop image`, `Extend canvas`, and `Quick image tools`,
  `/api/sitemap.xml` contained 118 URLs, and robots exposed the sitemap directive.
  GitHub build/typecheck and security checks passed; the separate Workers check did
  not. The browser flow saw one external certificate warning from a remote resource,
  but no application exception.
```

### Current Design Studio correction pass (2026-09-07)

```text
Status: complete — approved customer-facing correction pass implemented
Last completed: Established a single visible photoreal preview path, made uploads
  paint before auto-fix, aligned image controls to artwork bounds, tightened
  touch targets and pointer capture, compacted mobile guidance, added the
  safe-area sticky purchase dock, and shortened server background-removal waits.
Files/areas changed: customer Design Studio preview, upload/processing flow,
  CanvasArea interaction controls, mobile guidance/layout, sticky purchase bar,
  regression coverage, and approved design spec under docs/superpowers/specs.
Remaining work: None within the approved customer-facing scope.
Blocker: None. Redis is unavailable in development, but the documented in-process
  cache fallback is active and API/database health is still serving normally.
Next safe action: If desired, publish this verified storefront build; admin
  mockup screens and the separate mobile app remain outside this pass.
Verification: storefront typecheck passed; storefront production build passed;
  all 19 storefront test files and 67 tests passed; API typecheck/build passed;
  API health/products/settings smoke checks passed; desktop and 402px mobile
  preview captures show the canonical photoreal surface; runtime asset audit
  found 188 complete surfaces across all six mockup families.
```

The approved Design Studio V2 reliability pass is complete and has been pushed
through the GitHub-connected external rollout. The public `/design-studio` route is
the active V2 implementation; `/design-studio-v1` and `/design-studio-v2`
are compatibility aliases to that route. The source-kit/runtime mockup audit
now validates the editable manifest as well as public assets.

The genuine six-family PSD/PSB Smart Mockup workstream has passed its quarantine
structural and visual gates. The complete Smart v10.3 runtime package is active
in the local customer runtime and is published to GitHub; Smart v9 remains a
separate protected migration contract. The public hosting rollout remains a
separate provider step; do not describe local promotion as a production deploy.

### Current live audit checkpoint (2026-09-06, latest)

```text
Status: complete — provider rollout independently verified
Last completed: Rechecked the connected Cloudflare Pages deployment at
  `https://trynext.pages.dev` after the Smart v10.3 release. The
  deployed gateway returns the current primary Render origin and exposes the
  reviewed canonical runtime package.
Stopped at: Non-mutating live API, asset, retired-path, bundle, sitemap, and
  robots checks all passed. The public rollout is certified for the requested
  Smart v10.3 serving contract; Smart v9 remains a separate fail-closed contract.
Files/areas changed: this handoff only. No application, mockup, order, payment,
  or production data was changed.
Remaining work: Keep the live smoke checks repeatable after future provider
  deployments; no blocker remains for this rollout verification.
Blocker: None for the verified Cloudflare Pages + Render serving contract.
Next safe action: Add a scheduled or deployment-triggered equivalent of the
  non-mutating live mockup smoke check so edge regressions are caught promptly.
Verification: The deployed `/api/mockups` response contains exactly 188 rows,
  all canonical and all `smart-v10.3`; all 188 unique API-derived canonical
  runtime-role PNG URLs returned 200 `image/png`; representative retired
  `/mockups/*` namespaces returned 410; the deployed JavaScript bundle loaded
  by the HTML contains `smart-v10.3` and `runtime-roles`; `/sitemap.xml`
  redirects to the healthy 200 `/api/sitemap.xml` (118 URLs); and
  `/robots.txt` returned 200 with a sitemap directive. No order, payment, or
  production data changed.
```

## PSD/PSB server ingestion and Design Studio diagnostics checkpoint (2026-09-07)

```text
Status: complete — local server-side ingestion and studio UX verified
Last completed: Added a real ag-psd-backed PSD/PSB parser that reads private
  object-storage bytes, verifies Photoshop magic/version, extension/MIME,
  dimensions, exactly one named Smart Object layer, placement metadata, and
  SHA-256. Admin mockup creation/update now fails closed on parser or source-kit
  contract errors and persists the server-derived file metadata and normalized
  manifest. Editable masters remain private /objects paths; previews remain
  public image URLs.
Stopped at: After rebuilding/restarting the API and confirming the public API,
  readiness, workflows, Design Studio preview, focused parser/contract tests,
  full API tests, storefront typecheck/build, and git diff validation.
Files/areas changed: artifacts/api-server/src/lib/psdMasterParser.ts and its
  tests, mockupContract.ts, routes/mockups.ts, api-server package/lock metadata,
  AdminMockups.tsx, the active Smart v10-v3 manifest test path, and the
  DesignStudioV2 Smart Object status card.
Remaining work: Authenticated admin visual review of real upload success/failure
  states and owner-controlled hosting/GitHub publication remain separate release
  gates. The browser continues to render approved PNG runtime roles; private
  editable masters are diagnostics/provenance only.
Blocker: None for the local implementation. The running API reports the existing
  optional Redis degradation while DB-backed readiness remains healthy.
Next safe action: Exercise one authenticated canonical PSD override and one PSB
  override in Admin Mockups, then repeat the non-mutating public Smart v10.3
  runtime smoke checks before any provider rollout.
Verification: Real PSD and PSB parser fixtures passed; invalid bytes and
  signature/extension/MIME mismatch tests passed; API typecheck/build passed;
  full API suite passed (10 files, 36 tests); storefront typecheck/build passed;
  focused storefront manifest/product/composer tests passed; both managed
  workflows restarted cleanly; /api/mockups and /api/health/readiness returned
  200; Design Studio screenshot rendered without browser-console errors; and
  git diff --check passed. No order, payment, or production data changed.
```

## Latest Smart v10.3 API ingestion boundary checkpoint (2026-09-07)

```text
Status: complete — local Option A ingestion and server-render contract implemented
Last completed: Added fail-closed Smart v10.3 manifest validation for admin PSD/PSB
  records, including source-kit identity, PSD/PSB metadata, SHA-256 binding,
  Smart Object provenance, print geometry, and all six runtime role paths,
  provenance labels, and checksums. Invalid or incomplete master records are
  persisted as failed with actionable ingestion errors instead of being marked
  ready from a preview alone. The admin upload flow now derives the reviewed
  runtime manifest for canonical overrides and displays the server result/error.
  `/api/mockup/render` now accepts only the validated surface contract and six
  checksum-matching role images; the previous arbitrary base/mask/texture shape
  is rejected.
Stopped at: After rebuilding/restarting the API, passing route-level render
  tests, confirming `/api/healthz` and `/api/mockups` through the running service,
  confirming the renderer rejects the legacy payload at `/api/mockup/render`, and
  capturing a clean storefront preview.
Files/areas changed: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/mockupContract.ts`,
  `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/mockupContract.test.ts`,
  `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/mockups.ts`,
  `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/mockupRender.ts`,
  `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/mockupRender.test.ts`, and
  `artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/admin/AdminMockups.tsx`.
Remaining work: Owner-controlled GitHub/hosting promotion remains separate from
  this local implementation. Authenticated admin visual review of the upload
  error/ready states and visual approval of all 188 surfaces are still release
  gates; this checkpoint does not claim either one.
Blocker: None for local implementation. Health reports the existing optional
  Upstash Redis degradation while DB-backed readiness remains healthy.
Next safe action: Review the authenticated admin mockup upload state, then
  publish the verified local source through the owner-controlled rollout if
  desired. Do not bypass the manifest gate for arbitrary PSD/PSB uploads.
Verification: API typecheck passed; API build passed; API tests passed (9 files,
  33 tests); focused Smart v10.3 contract/render tests passed (3 files, 7
  tests); storefront typecheck passed; storefront tests passed (19 files,
  64 tests); storefront production build passed before the final manifest-form
  wiring and focused typecheck passed after it; active runtime matrix passed
  (188 surfaces, 1,128 roles); correct v10-v3 release gate passed
  structurally-verified 188/188; both managed workflows restarted cleanly;
  health/mockups/root routes returned 200; legacy renderer payload returned
  400; storefront screenshot had no browser-console errors; `git diff --check`
  passed. No order, payment, or production data was changed.
```

## Latest studio correction checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: locally verified; GitHub publication of this continuation is still pending
Last completed: Added deterministic selection-aware undo/redo coverage, grouped
  drag/resize/rotate history transactions, the shared red 44px delete control,
  grouped product and mug-view switching, and removed the redundant post-switch
  transform loop. Fixed the compositor canvas-reset regression so artwork no
  longer erases the already-drawn studio background/base. Runtime shadow and
  highlight roles now use the reviewed grayscale print mask, and 3D artwork
  textures receive the same protected/detail role pass as the 2D compositor.
  Updated the asset audit script to inspect the active v10.3 runtime tree.
Stopped at: Local storefront/API workflows are running cleanly. Storefront
  typecheck, 18 test files/59 tests, production build, API typecheck, 188-surface
  matrix validation, 1,128-role validation, route/API smoke checks, and desktop
  plus mobile Design Studio previews passed. The water-bottle preview visibly
  retains the cap key-ring loop from the reviewed base asset.
Files/areas changed: Design Studio history/store, CanvasArea/DesignLayer controls,
  product and mug routing, shared 2D/3D compositor role handling, focused store
  tests, and the active mockup audit script.
Remaining work: Commit and push only these verified source changes, then recheck
  the GitHub-connected Cloudflare Pages rollout independently. The current public
  Pages host returns healthy 200 responses, but its current HTML bundle has not
  exposed a new Smart v10.3 marker and the edge rollout must not be called
  complete without checking canonical and retired mockup URLs.
Blocker: Replit publishing is not configured for this workspace. Cloudflare
  management API access is provider-managed; public Pages health is available,
  but rollout freshness is separate from the local/GitHub result.
Next safe action: Commit/push the verified continuation, re-run the public
  Pages API/asset/sitemap/robots and retired-path checks, then record the result
  without changing the Smart v9 fail-closed contract.
Verification: storefront typecheck/build/tests passed; API typecheck passed;
  both managed workflows restarted cleanly; local route/API checks returned 200;
  protected admin probes returned 401; active matrix validators passed 188/188
  and 1,128/1,128; desktop and mobile previews showed no browser console errors;
  Cloudflare Pages root, Design Studio, liveness, sitemap, and robots returned
  200; no order, payment, or production data was mutated.
```

### Current image-tools continuation checkpoint (2026-09-07)

```text
Status: GitHub feature commit published; Cloudflare edge propagation pending
Last completed: Implemented the selected Tools-first image interaction. A successful
  upload selects the image and opens the Upload image-tools panel immediately;
  one click on an image only selects it; double-click/double-tap opens the same
  full tools surface; and the panel now provides functional crop-frame handles
  plus transparent canvas extension controls for desktop and mobile.
Stopped at: The storefront and API workflows are running cleanly after the final
  build and proxied smoke checks.
Files/areas changed: DesignStudioV2 upload/tool routing, ImagePanel controls, and
  the new ImageCropExtendDialog editor.
Remaining work: Let the connected Cloudflare Pages rollout finish, then verify
  the live bundle and exercise upload → tools → crop/extend in a browser.
Blocker: The browser-use helper is not installed in this checkout, so direct
  file-chooser automation was unavailable; static preview, build, tests, and
  route/API checks all passed.
Next safe action: Check the GitHub CI/active-app runs and the public Pages bundle;
  do not call live rollout complete until the new tools strings are present.
Verification: Storefront typecheck passed; storefront tests passed (19 files/64
  tests); storefront production build passed; both managed workflows are running;
  `/design-studio`, `/api/healthz`, and `/api/products` returned 200; and
  `git diff --check` passed; GitHub main now points to commit
  7874b96caa1219117234e951ef19b55f92fc7b46; the public Pages root, Design Studio,
  and API health endpoints returned 200 but still served the previous bundle at
  the last check; Replit deployment metadata reports no published Replit app.
  No order, payment, or production data changed.
```

## Current studio correction plan (2026-09-06)

```text
Goal: make the Design Studio trustworthy for real customer editing and photoreal
  product previews, using the reviewed Smart v10.3 runtime without overlapping
  controls, duplicate garment passes, or silent fallback assets.

Stage 1 — Selection and editing controls
  - Add a clearly visible red circular remove button at the selected artwork
    bounds, positioned outside the top-right edge and kept above the artwork.
  - Make the remove control a 44px minimum touch target with an accessible label,
    keyboard activation, pointer capture isolation, and a delete action that
    records exactly one undo frame.
  - Make selection hit areas transparent and reliable for mouse, touch, and
    stylus; prevent the rotate/resize/delete controls from starting a drag.
  - Verify the control on desktop and mobile, including rotated artwork and
    artwork near the canvas edge.

Stage 2 — History correctness
  - Audit every meaningful mutation path: add, delete, drag, resize, rotate,
    text edits, visibility/lock changes, reorder, product/color/face changes.
  - Group pointer gestures into one history entry on pointer-up rather than one
    entry per movement; preserve redo only until a new edit occurs.
  - Preserve selection state and product/face context across undo/redo without
    restoring stale runtime asset URLs.
  - Add focused store tests for one-step delete undo/redo, grouped transforms,
    redo invalidation, product/face restoration, and empty-stack no-ops.

Stage 3 — Photoreal composition and protected details
  - Trace the v10.3 print mask/role order so artwork is clipped to the real print
    area and garment details remain above it.
  - Ensure hoodie drawstrings, collar, pocket seam, sleeve seams, mug handles,
    cap brim/panel seams, and bottle cap/key-ring hardware are protected details,
    never painted over by artwork.
  - Remove any remaining full-frame duplicate base/shadow pass; keep one base
    silhouette plus intentional role layers only.
  - Compare browser SVG, canvas export, cart preview, and 3D preview for the
    same surface and artwork placement.

Stage 4 — Product-specific surface routing
  - Fix mug side1/side2/front/back mapping so the visible handle orientation,
    print zone, and runtime surface agree; keep Wrap explicit and wider.
  - Verify long sleeve/hoodie sleeve faces route to the corresponding canonical
    v10.3 role files rather than reusing the front.
  - Repair the water-bottle front/back source/role composition and restore the
    cap key-ring detail from reviewed source assets or a reviewed runtime role;
    fail closed if the required detail source is absent rather than inventing it.
  - Add route/asset contract tests for all curved-product faces and representative
    apparel protected details.

Stage 5 — Runtime/source audit and rollout
  - Audit the source manifests, role PNG alpha bounds, protected/detail layers,
    and representative photoreal composites for all six product families.
  - Keep editable PSD/PSB masters outside public/ and expose only reviewed v10.3
    runtime derivatives.
  - Run storefront/API typechecks, focused/full tests, production build, local
    proxy checks, desktop/mobile browser previews, and no-legacy-path checks.
  - Commit/push the verified source, wait for Cloudflare Pages deployment, then
    verify public API=188 canonical rows, canonical assets=200, retired paths=410,
    sitemap/robots, and deployed bundle markers.

Acceptance gates:
  - No selection control overlaps artwork or is swallowed by the canvas edge.
  - Delete/undo/redo works deterministically for mouse and touch gestures.
  - No hoodie strings, collars, seams, handles, or bottle hardware are painted
    over by artwork in browser, cart, export, or 3D previews.
  - Mug side routing and water-bottle detail are visually and structurally
    verified; missing source data fails loudly.
  - Public rollout is not called complete until the Pages checks pass.
```

## Latest studio correction checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: locally verified; GitHub publication of this continuation is still pending
Last completed: Added deterministic selection-aware undo/redo coverage, grouped
  drag/resize/rotate history transactions, the shared red 44px delete control,
  grouped product and mug-view switching, and removed the redundant post-switch
  transform loop. Fixed the compositor canvas-reset regression so artwork no
  longer erases the already-drawn studio background/base. Runtime shadow and
  highlight roles now use the reviewed grayscale print mask, and 3D artwork
  textures receive the same protected/detail role pass as the 2D compositor.
  Updated the asset audit script to inspect the active v10.3 runtime tree.
Stopped at: Local storefront/API workflows are running cleanly. Storefront
  typecheck, 18 test files/59 tests, production build, API typecheck, 188-surface
  matrix validation, 1,128-role validation, route/API smoke checks, and desktop
  plus mobile Design Studio previews passed. The water-bottle preview visibly
  retains the cap key-ring loop from the reviewed base asset.
Files/areas changed: Design Studio history/store, CanvasArea/DesignLayer controls,
  product and mug routing, shared 2D/3D compositor role handling, focused store
  tests, and the active mockup audit script.
Remaining work: Commit and push only these verified source changes, then recheck
  the GitHub-connected Cloudflare Pages rollout independently. The current public
  Pages host returns healthy 200 responses, but its current HTML bundle has not
  exposed a new Smart v10.3 marker and the edge rollout must not be called
  complete without checking canonical and retired mockup URLs.
Blocker: Replit publishing is not configured for this workspace. Cloudflare
  management API access is provider-managed; public Pages health is available,
  but rollout freshness is separate from the local/GitHub result.
Next safe action: Commit/push the verified continuation, re-run the public
  Pages API/asset/sitemap/robots and retired-path checks, then record the result
  without changing the Smart v9 fail-closed contract.
Verification: storefront typecheck/build/tests passed; API typecheck passed;
  both managed workflows restarted cleanly; local route/API checks returned 200;
  protected admin probes returned 401; active matrix validators passed 188/188
  and 1,128/1,128; desktop and mobile previews showed no browser console errors;
  Cloudflare Pages root, Design Studio, liveness, sitemap, and robots returned
  200; no order, payment, or production data was mutated.
```

## Current studio correction plan (2026-09-06)

```text
Goal: make the Design Studio trustworthy for real customer editing and photoreal
  product previews, using the reviewed Smart v10.3 runtime without overlapping
  controls, duplicate garment passes, or silent fallback assets.

Stage 1 — Selection and editing controls
  - Add a clearly visible red circular remove button at the selected artwork
    bounds, positioned outside the top-right edge and kept above the artwork.
  - Make the remove control a 44px minimum touch target with an accessible label,
    keyboard activation, pointer capture isolation, and a delete action that
    records exactly one undo frame.
  - Make selection hit areas transparent and reliable for mouse, touch, and
    stylus; prevent the rotate/resize/delete controls from starting a drag.
  - Verify the control on desktop and mobile, including rotated artwork and
    artwork near the canvas edge.

Stage 2 — History correctness
  - Audit every meaningful mutation path: add, delete, drag, resize, rotate,
    text edits, visibility/lock changes, reorder, product/color/face changes.
  - Group pointer gestures into one history entry on pointer-up rather than one
    entry per movement; preserve redo only until a new edit occurs.
  - Preserve selection state and product/face context across undo/redo without
    restoring stale runtime asset URLs.
  - Add focused store tests for one-step delete undo/redo, grouped transforms,
    redo invalidation, product/face restoration, and empty-stack no-ops.

Stage 3 — Photoreal composition and protected details
  - Trace the v10.3 print mask/role order so artwork is clipped to the real print
    area and garment details remain above it.
  - Ensure hoodie drawstrings, collar, pocket seam, sleeve seams, mug handles,
    cap brim/panel seams, and bottle cap/key-ring hardware are protected details,
    never painted over by artwork.
  - Remove any remaining full-frame duplicate base/shadow pass; keep one base
    silhouette plus intentional role layers only.
  - Compare browser SVG, canvas export, cart preview, and 3D preview for the
    same surface and artwork placement.

Stage 4 — Product-specific surface routing
  - Fix mug side1/side2/front/back mapping so the visible handle orientation,
    print zone, and runtime surface agree; keep Wrap explicit and wider.
  - Verify long sleeve/hoodie sleeve faces route to the corresponding canonical
    v10.3 role files rather than reusing the front.
  - Repair the water-bottle front/back source/role composition and restore the
    cap key-ring detail from reviewed source assets or a reviewed runtime role;
    fail closed if the required detail source is absent rather than inventing it.
  - Add route/asset contract tests for all curved-product faces and representative
    apparel protected details.

Stage 5 — Runtime/source audit and rollout
  - Audit the source manifests, role PNG alpha bounds, protected/detail layers,
    and representative photoreal composites for all six product families.
  - Keep editable PSD/PSB masters outside public/ and expose only reviewed v10.3
    runtime derivatives.
  - Run storefront/API typechecks, focused/full tests, production build, local
    proxy checks, desktop/mobile browser previews, and no-legacy-path checks.
  - Commit/push the verified source, wait for Cloudflare Pages deployment, then
    verify public API=188 canonical rows, canonical assets=200, retired paths=410,
    sitemap/robots, and deployed bundle markers.

Acceptance gates:
  - No selection control overlaps artwork or is swallowed by the canvas edge.
  - Delete/undo/redo works deterministically for mouse and touch gestures.
  - No hoodie strings, collars, seams, handles, or bottle hardware are painted
    over by artwork in browser, cart, export, or 3D previews.
  - Mug side routing and water-bottle detail are visually and structurally
    verified; missing source data fails loudly.
  - Public rollout is not called complete until the Pages checks pass.
```

### Current Smart v9 acceptance checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: in progress — Smart v9 remains fail-closed while visual acceptance is
  incomplete.
Last completed: Fixed curved-product 3D billboard framing for mug, cap, and
  water bottle; restarted the storefront; captured fresh real uploaded-artwork
  Studio/3D evidence for all six product families; and confirmed the bottle
  now fits from cap to base while the cap visor no longer clips.
Compatibility rule: exact catalog-color matches may use Smart v9 only after the
  full evidence gate is accepted. Ambiguous shades such as Charcoal, Royal
  Blue, and Sand remain on reviewed color-specific assets.
Verification: canonical matrix and Smart Object structural gates remain
  188/188; storefront typecheck passed; storefront workflow is running; fresh
  uploaded-artwork evidence has no browser console errors; API healthz and
  mockups/settings/products/readiness routes returned 200; storefront tests
  passed (25 files/85 tests); storefront production build passed; root
  workspace typecheck passed; git diff --check passed. No orders, payments, or
  production data were created or changed.
Remaining work: Run the full storefront test/build/validator pass; capture and
  review all required color/face evidence plus transparent-upload, cart, and
  export outputs; only then consider Smart v9 activation and production
  promotion.
Next safe action: complete the non-mutating release verification and keep
  SMART_V9_PROMOTION_ALLOWED=false until every required evidence category is
  recorded and accepted.
```

### Current v10 implementation checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: verified and pushed v10.3 release — hosting rollout remains separate
Last completed: Replaced the weak/inconsistent v10 source inputs with a reviewed,
  consistent photoreal six-family source set; rebuilt the complete 188-surface
  matrix with genuine embedded Smart Objects and 1,128 browser-safe role PNGs;
  archived the superseded runtime; promoted the verified replacement into the
  active v10 path; and confirmed the customer Design Studio renders it.
Stopped at: GitHub `main` update after final local verification; the connected
  hosting rollout can now proceed independently.
Files/areas changed: `attached_assets/generated_images/v10-sources-v3`,
  `tools/build-smartobject-mockups.mjs`, `tools/validate-smartobject-release.mjs`,
  `dist-mockups/staging/smart-v10`, archived prior v10 staging assets,
  `artifacts/trynex-storefront/public/mockups/psd-master-v10/runtime-roles`,
  visual evidence, and this handoff.
Remaining work: Confirm the connected hosting deployment serves the new runtime
  when its normal GitHub rollout completes. Keep the separate Smart v9
  production contract fail-closed.
Blocker: No local or GitHub implementation blocker. Live rollout depends on the
  connected hosting deployment completing normally.
Next safe action: Run non-mutating live asset/health checks after the hosting
  provider reports the pushed `main` revision is deployed.
Verification: v10.3 structural gate passed 188/188; every master reopened at
  1024×1024, 8-bit RGB with one non-empty embedded Smart Object; 1,128 runtime
  roles were exported; representative runtime assets returned HTTP 200;
  storefront tests passed (25 files/85 tests); storefront and root typechecks
  passed; storefront production build passed; managed workflows restarted
  cleanly; and the Design Studio preview showed the photoreal T-shirt runtime
  without browser console errors. Redis remains an optional degraded fallback.
```

### Current session checkpoint (2026-09-05)

```text
Status: implementation complete locally — production promotion remains blocked on visual acceptance
Last completed: Repaired the typed fail-closed source-kit contract, routed Studio,
  3D, cart, export, and order metadata through the shared surface compositor,
  preserved reviewed PSD/source-matrix/Water Bottle releases, and added explicit
  disabled-surface UI blocking plus focused manifest/compositor failure tests.
Stopped at: Final local verification after restarting the managed application.
Files/areas changed: design-studio manifest/resolver/compositor integration,
  DesignStudioV2 surface blocking, MainToolbar export guard, focused contract tests,
  and this handoff.
Remaining work: Generate and review real uploaded-artwork diagnostic-grid and
  transparent-upload evidence across the six product families and required faces,
  then compare Studio, 3D, cart, and export output before any Smart v9 promotion.
Blocker: Production promotion remains blocked until real visual evidence is
  reviewed. This checkout is not registered in the artifact preview registry,
  and its external development proxy is unavailable, so screenshot/browser
  verification could not be completed here.
Next safe action: Obtain an authenticated browser/runtime review or equivalent
  visual evidence without creating test orders, and record per-surface approval
  or rejection before promoting Smart v9.
Verification: Storefront typecheck passed; storefront Vitest passed with 24 files
  and 82 tests; storefront production build passed; managed workflow restarted
  cleanly; local Design Studio route returned 200; local API liveness returned
  200; representative source-matrix asset returned successfully; git diff check
  passed. Artifact screenshot failed because `trynext-storefront` is absent from
  the artifact registry.
```

### Current session checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: verified local release merged with GitHub main; Smart v9 production promotion remains blocked
Last completed: Reconnected GitHub, confirmed the remote main ancestry, merged the five
  remote-only commits without force-pushing, and retained the newer local Design Studio
  surface guards, compositor path, mug-aware product switching, and export state.
  Completed full workspace typecheck, API/storefront tests, storefront build, design-system
  typecheck/build, and both 188-surface mockup validators.
Stopped at: Post-merge verification and normal push of the merge result.
Files/areas changed: merge reconciliation, design-system native theme support, and
  release cleanup removing the attached transcript and local node_modules symlink from git.
Remaining work: Run post-merge tests and non-mutating route/API checks, push the merge
  result to GitHub, then confirm GitHub Actions and the live Cloudflare Pages/Render
  surfaces. Do not promote Smart v9 without real visual acceptance.
Blocker: The design-system artifact files are complete and buildable, but the platform
  artifact registry still returns ARTIFACT_NOT_FOUND, so it cannot be presented through
  the artifact preview or screenshot path. Redis remains optional and is using fallback.
Next safe action: Finish post-merge non-mutating verification and publish the verified
  application history through the connected GitHub integration.
Verification: API tests passed (6 files/26 tests); storefront tests passed (24 files/82
  tests); full workspace typecheck passed; storefront production build passed; design-system
  build passed with its required PORT and BASE_PATH; mockup validators passed 188/188 and
  checksum validation; managed application workflow is running cleanly.
```

### Current visual review checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: local storefront/API visual review complete; Smart v9 production promotion remains blocked
Last completed: Reviewed the public storefront across desktop and mobile, including
  homepage, shop, product detail, Design Studio, cart, empty checkout, FAQ, size guide,
  tracking, contact, about, blog, terms, and privacy. Fixed the product viewer heartbeat
  browser error by preserving the CSRF marker in the client and allowing known local
  preview origins in development even when ALLOWED_ORIGINS is set. The public viewer
  endpoint remains explicitly non-sensitive and works for cached clients with customer
  cookies.
Stopped at: Final product/mobile screenshot and non-mutating API/browser verification.
Files/areas changed: API CORS development-origin handling, public viewer-heartbeat
  handling, and the current visual-review evidence.
Remaining work: Review authenticated customer/admin surfaces with a real browser if
  required, and complete visual/runtime acceptance of all 188 Smart v9 surfaces before
  any production mockup promotion.
Blocker: Smart v9 visual approval is still intentionally unavailable; Redis credentials
  remain rejected locally while the documented fallback is healthy. The legacy
  Start application workflow was removed because it conflicted with the artifact-owned
  storefront/API workflows; both managed artifact workflows are running.
Next safe action: Use the artifact-owned storefront and API workflows for future local
  verification, then publish only after the owner reviews the remaining gated surfaces.
Verification: Product viewer PUT returned 200 with and without the client CSRF header
  when a customer cookie and local preview Origin were present; CORS preflight returned
  204; protected admin mutation returned 401; all sampled public SPA routes returned
  200; shop cards loaded real product images; storefront typecheck and API build passed;
  git diff --check passed; no order, payment, or production data was mutated.
```


## Controlled review checkpoint (2026-09-03)

```text
Status: blocked — controlled review completed without authenticated browser evidence
Last completed: Restarted the managed application, checked non-mutating customer/admin
  route and API behavior, validated the complete 188-surface candidate, and compared
  staged previews with the public Smart v9 tree.
Stopped at: Owner visual approval could not be recorded because browser-use is not
  installed and the artifact preview registry cannot resolve this checkout.
Files/areas changed: verification/task-1-controlled-review-2026-09-03.md and this
  handoff only; no runtime or release manifest approval flag changed.
Remaining work: Review authenticated Checkout, Account/messages, admin Orders/Settings/
  messages, and representative Design Studio views in a real browser; then record
  per-surface approval or rejection for all 188 surfaces.
Blocker: No authenticated customer/admin browser session, no browser-use CLI, and no
  artifact screenshot target. Smart v9 remains staged and visualApproval=false.
Next safe action: Obtain a real authenticated browser review without creating an order
  or payment record. Resolve the two water-bottle staged/public hash discrepancies
  during that review before any promotion decision.
Verification: Workflow restarted cleanly; SPA route GETs returned 200; invalid order
  and message probes were rejected without mutation; admin session returned 401;
  canonical validator reported 188/188; staged previews matched their manifest
  checksums 188/188; public Smart v9 matched staged previews 186/188; git diff
  remains limited to the review record and handoff.
```

## Latest local commerce and mockup reliability checkpoint (2026-09-03)

```text
Status: complete for the verified local commerce/dependency scope; Smart v9 production promotion remains fail-closed
Last completed: Aligned web/mobile/API payment contracts, made payment evidence contact-authorized and retry-safe, added server-side bank evidence validation, normalized payment methods and direct tracking responses, normalized persisted legacy site-name values at the public settings boundary, upgraded the vulnerable Orval/Tiptap dependency chains, and reconciled the obsolete 202-surface validator to the active 188-surface Smart v9 gate.
Stopped at: After rebuilding and restarting the API workflow, running the full test/typecheck/build suite, completing non-mutating proxied smoke checks, rendering and visually inspecting all 12 audit-PDF pages, and verifying the compatibility validator.
Files/areas changed: API order/payment/settings/message routes, API email and seeded copy, mobile checkout/API wrapper/app branding, storefront checkout/settings/studio copy, generated API clients, dependency manifests/lockfile, mockup validator/docs, audit PDF tooling, and this handoff.
Remaining work: None for the verified local commerce/dependency scope. Authenticated browser review and controlled visual/runtime acceptance of all 188 Smart v9 surfaces are still required before any production mockup promotion.
Blocker: The artifact preview registry cannot resolve this checkout for screenshot capture; the previous handoff also records that browser-use is unavailable. Local Redis credentials remain rejected, while the documented fallback is operating.
Next safe action: Review the authenticated Checkout, Account messages, and Design Studio routes in a real browser. Keep Smart v9 staged until visual/runtime evidence is accepted; do not create test orders during review.
Verification: `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate` reports 0 advisories; API tests 6 files/26 tests and storefront tests 22 files/76 tests passed; API/storefront/mobile/full-workspace typechecks passed; storefront production build and mobile Expo web export passed; 188/188 active Smart v9 validation passed; the legacy validator delegates successfully; API rebuilt and the managed workflow restarted cleanly; proxied liveness/readiness/products/categories/settings/blog/sitemap/robots returned expected 200 responses; `/api/settings` now returns `Trynext Lifestyle` despite the legacy persisted value; invalid order/payment-info/message probes rejected without creating records; all 12 audit-PDF pages rendered and were visually inspected; no order or payment data was mutated; `git diff --check` passed. Screenshot attempt failed with "Artifact not found: trynext-storefront".
```

### Redis and readiness note

Redis is an optional, disposable cache. PostgreSQL remains the source of truth for
products, orders, settings, and other persistent data. The configured Upstash Redis
provider currently rejects its credentials, so the API uses its documented
process-local in-memory cache fallback with TTLs; a process restart clears that
cache but does not remove database data. `/api/healthz` may therefore report
`degraded` with `redis: "error"`, while `/api/health/readiness` can still report
`status: "ok"` because readiness checks the database required to serve requests.

## Current continuation checkpoint (2026-09-01)

```text
Status: in progress — local runtime resolver repaired and ready for visual review
Last completed: Activated the tracked 188-surface smart-v9 candidate for exact
  runtime matches, preserved the reviewed PSD-derived T-shirt front/back bases,
  and kept ambiguous Hoodie/Long Sleeve catalog shades on their reviewed
  color-specific source-matrix assets instead of mapping them to the wrong hue.
Stopped at: After a clean workflow restart and direct proxied asset checks.
Files/areas changed: Design Studio mockup resolver and the two related source
  matrix test files.
Remaining work: Perform a real browser visual review of the Customize/Design
  Studio flow and, if required, regenerate a product-color-aligned v9 candidate
  for the currently unmatched Hoodie/Long Sleeve shades before production
  promotion.
Blocker: The artifact preview registry cannot resolve this checkout for a
  screenshot; direct proxy checks are available and passing.
Next safe action: Review the Customize route with the 188 staged assets, then
  approve or regenerate only the unmatched product-color surfaces.
Verification: Storefront tests 22 files/76 tests passed; storefront typecheck,
  full workspace typecheck, production build, workflow restart, git diff check,
  and representative v9/source-matrix/PSD asset requests passed. Screenshot
  capture was unavailable because the artifact was not found in the registry.
```

## Current handoff (2026-09-02)

Status: ready for review — the shared admin shell, Products workspace, and
Settings workspace have been redesigned in place; Smart Object production
promotion remains fail-closed.
Last completed: Applied the approved operator-console redesign while preserving
the existing admin shell routes and settings/product fields. Added responsive
navigation and accessibility affordances, catalogue KPIs and filters, clearer
product create/edit/delete feedback, gallery and cloud-image handling,
structured variants, color availability, CSV import, AI descriptions, duplicate
slug protection, grouped settings navigation, dirty/saving/saved states, and a
sticky settings save action. Reconciled the product API so color availability
round-trips, sale prices can be cleared, and duplicate slugs return a useful
conflict response.
Stopped at: After a clean API/storefront typecheck and production build,
focused API tests, managed workflow restart, public proxied smoke checks, and
preservation checks confirming no existing admin route or registered form field
was removed. A fresh browser screenshot could not be captured because this
checkout is absent from the artifact registry and the browser-use CLI is
unavailable.
Files/areas changed: `artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/components/layout/AdminLayout.tsx`,
`artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/admin/AdminProducts.tsx`,
`artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/admin/AdminSettings.tsx`,
`artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/index.css`, and
`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/products.ts`.
Remaining work: Extend the same approved interaction language to the remaining
admin screens if the owner wants the full panel rewritten; perform controlled
browser/runtime visual comparison and explicit visual acceptance for all 188
Smart Object surfaces before promoting any runtime derivatives or manifest
data. Authenticated admin-health success is not claimed without a safe existing
session or in-process credential path.
Blocker: Artifact screenshot registry and browser-use are unavailable in this
checkout. Upstash Redis is degraded because the environment rejects its
credentials, while the documented fallback is healthy. Replit's dependency
scanner fails with `OSV_SCAN_FAILED` because its `osv` executable is absent;
the local `pnpm audit` is clean and the lockfile contains no upstream
`image-size` package.
Next safe action: Review the redesigned Products and Settings screens with a
real authenticated browser session, then continue the remaining admin-screen
redesign only as an explicitly approved follow-up. Keep
`masterStatus: manifest-only` / `structurally-verified` until Smart Object
visual/runtime evidence is complete.
Verification: Smart Object release gate 188/188 passed; PSD reopen audit
188/188 passed at 1024x1024 8-bit with one non-empty embedded Smart Object and
composite per file; canonical matrix 188/188 passed; contact sheets reviewed;
focused API tests 6 files/26 tests passed; storefront and API typechecks passed;
storefront production build passed; workflow restart, healthz, products,
categories, settings, and unauthenticated admin 401 checks passed; git diff
check passed. The redesigned admin screens retain all previously registered
product/settings fields and all current admin menu routes. The artifact
registry could not capture a fresh screenshot.

## Latest admin continuation checkpoint (2026-09-02)

```text
Status: ready for review — focused admin operations hardening is complete
Last completed: Extended the existing admin interaction language to Categories,
  Reviews, Promo Codes, and Newsletter without changing their API contracts.
  Added searchable category filtering and catalogue KPIs, review queue KPIs and
  rating summary, promo-code validation/error recovery and operational KPIs, and
  newsletter refresh/error states plus formula-injection-safe CSV export.
Stopped at: After a clean full typecheck, storefront production build, API test
  run, Smart Object matrix validation, managed workflow restart, and proxied
  public/protected smoke checks.
Files/areas changed: `artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/admin/AdminCategories.tsx`,
  `AdminReviews.tsx`, `AdminPromoCodes.tsx`, and `AdminNewsletter.tsx`.
Remaining work: Review these screens with a real authenticated browser session;
  continue the same treatment on lower-priority operational screens only if the
  owner wants the full panel standardized. Smart Object production promotion is
  still blocked on controlled visual/runtime acceptance of all 188 surfaces.
Blocker: The artifact registry cannot resolve this checkout for screenshots, so
  visual acceptance is unavailable here. Replit deployment is not yet published
  and requires the owner to use the Publish action.
Next safe action: Push the verified source to GitHub main, then publish this
  project from Replit after reviewing the authenticated admin and staged mockups.
Verification: Full workspace typecheck passed; storefront typecheck and
  production build passed; API tests 6 files/26 tests passed; Smart Object
  canonical matrix and 188/188 candidate validation passed; workflow restarted
  cleanly; healthz/products/categories/settings returned 200; unauthenticated
  admin checks returned 401; git diff --check passed. The proxied
  `/api/admin/orders` probe was not used as evidence because that path is not
  registered; no source change was made for it.
```

## Latest admin operations checkpoint (2026-09-02)

```text
Status: ready for review — focused admin operations hardening is complete
Last completed: Reconciled the unfinished order mutation loading state and
  date-aware cache updates, then standardized retryable load errors, visible
  pending states, accessible labels, and explicit destructive confirmations
  across orders, activity logs, backup/schema repair, deployment/system actions,
  Facebook import/guide, hampers, mockups, referrals, roles, SEO, and security.
  Existing routes, API contracts, permissions, registered fields, and Smart
  Object fail-closed behavior were preserved.
Stopped at: After the final storefront typecheck, workflow restart, and runtime
  smoke verification; production promotion and publishing were not attempted.
Files/areas changed: `artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/admin/` files
  `AdminActivityLog.tsx`, `AdminBackup.tsx`, `AdminDeployment.tsx`,
  `AdminFacebookGuide.tsx`, `AdminFacebookImport.tsx`, `AdminHampers.tsx`,
  `AdminMockups.tsx`, `AdminOrders.tsx`, `AdminReferrals.tsx`, `AdminRoles.tsx`,
  `AdminSEO.tsx`, and `AdminSecurity.tsx`.
Remaining work: Review the changed admin screens with a real authenticated
  browser session. Lower-priority screens such as AI Developer, Designer, Page
  Builder, Database Cluster, Tech Stack, Secrets, Customers, and Login still
  need a dedicated visual pass if the owner wants every admin route to share
  the same interaction language. Smart Object production promotion still
  requires controlled visual/runtime acceptance of all 188 surfaces.
Blocker: This checkout is absent from the artifact preview registry and the
  browser-use CLI is unavailable, so authenticated visual acceptance cannot be
  claimed. Local Redis credentials remain rejected; the documented fallback is
  operating. The dependency scanner still lacks its `osv` executable.
Next safe action: Review the authenticated admin routes and staged Smart Object
  surfaces, then either approve this batch for delivery or scope the remaining
  lower-priority admin screens as a separate pass. Keep staged mockups
  `manifest-only` / `structurally-verified` until visual/runtime evidence is
  complete.
Verification: Full workspace typecheck passed; storefront production build
  passed; API tests (6 files/26 tests) passed; storefront tests (22 files/76
  tests) passed; Smart Object matrix and 188/188 candidate validators passed;
  the managed workflow restarted cleanly; proxied health, products, and
  settings checks returned 200; `git diff --check` passed. The untracked
  credential-bearing attached note remains excluded from release changes.
```

## Latest local studio reliability pass (2026-09-01)

```text
Status: complete — external rollout is live; GitHub checks are still processing
Last completed: Hardened V2 draft recovery, deterministic in-browser image
  auto-fix, export/cart failure handling, original-asset preservation, active
  face geometry for generated layers, and product-zone-aware switching. Added
  undo/redo coverage for direct layer edits and product-aware history frames.
Stopped at: After pushing the verified source to GitHub main and confirming both
  public Pages and Render hosts return healthy application/API responses.
Files/areas changed: Design Studio V2 state/history and panels, product switcher,
  generated sticker/QR placement, and React type compatibility in sibling
  preview/design-system artifacts.
Remaining work: The six-family Smart Mockup implementation is now the active
  workstream. The revised spec requires representative proof masters,
  quarantined full-matrix generation, staged runtime comparison, and controlled
  production promotion.
Blocker: None for the approved studio reliability scope. Replit publishing is
  intentionally out of scope; local Redis credentials are degraded but the
  documented fallback is operating.
Next safe action: After the revised spec gate, implement and validate one
  representative real Smart Object master per family in staging before
  generating the complete 188-surface release.
Verification: Storefront typecheck and 76 tests passed; API typecheck passed;
  full workspace typecheck passed; storefront production build passed; the
  managed workflow restarted cleanly; local healthz/products/settings/robots/
  sitemap and invalid-order checks returned expected responses. The artifact
  registry and browser-use CLI were unavailable for a screenshot capture.
```

## Required status at every handoff

Every Agent must keep the following status fields current before ending a chat,
pausing work, or transferring the project.

### Active workstream — 4-Render main promotion

```text
Status: complete for the external production rollout
Last completed: Published the verified release to GitHub main through a clean
  history that excludes credential-bearing attachments. The active Render service
  auto-deployed commit ca1c202 and reached live status. Cloudflare Pages now
  routes the gateway to the primary Render service, whose health reports DB
  healthy, Redis healthy:primary, R2 storage, primary runtime, and scheduler on.
Stopped at: No runtime blocker remains for the approved CF Pages + Render +
  Upstash scope. Cloudflare's management API token returns Invalid API Token,
  but the Pages GitHub deployment and live gateway are functioning.
Files/areas changed: customer-facing URL references, API CORS defaults, Telegram
  summary URL, mobile production routing safeguards, operational audit scripts,
  docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md, API Redis/product caching and gateway budget handling,
  storefront homepage payload/image normalization, and this handoff. The attached
  credential-bearing text file and current evidence screenshots are excluded from
  the release history.
Remaining work: None for the external production rollout. The mockup master-layer
  decision remains paused as documented below.
Blocker: None for live storefront/API traffic. Do not copy credentials from
  attachments or re-add a retired domain.
Next safe action: Monitor the active Render service and Pages gateway. Replace
  only CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN through the secure Secrets UI before future Cloudflare
  API management, if needed.
Verification: See the latest external production verification below. Local app
  and API checks, typechecks, tests, workflow restart, and git diff --check passed.
  readiness, public stats, sitemap, and robots routes returned 200. Live headers
still show the older standby gateway because the latest local release has not
reached GitHub. Fresh local API checks and application build passed. A fresh
browser screenshot could not be captured because this checkout is absent from the
artifact preview registry and the browser-use CLI is unavailable.
```

### Active workstream — mockup master layer system

```text
Status: in progress — approved genuine Smart Object rebuild
Last completed: Direct binary audit of all 108 PSD/PSB masters in attached_assets/trynext-mockup-source-kit/psd using psd-tools 1.18.0. Findings written to MOCKUP_MASTER_AUDIT_2026-08-28.md and committed (8ee94e1). Re-runnable auditor added at tools/audit_psd_masters.py.
Stopped at: After the approved design was written. No new master or runtime asset has been released yet.
Files/areas changed: The audit and auditor remain the baseline; the approved specification is at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-01-six-family-psd-smart-mockup-design.md`, and `AGENTS.md` now records the system inputs, outputs, and fail-closed rules.
Remaining work: Build and validate the 188 canonical surfaces, including genuine embedded Smart Objects, reviewed missing faces, runtime manifest integration, and browser/PSD composite comparisons.
Blocker: None for starting the implementation. The writer must prove a real Smart Object round trip; if a free writer cannot produce a document that `psd-tools` reopens as a Smart Object, stop and repair the writer path rather than shipping another raster kit.
Next safe action: Build one representative surface for each family, run the structural auditor, and review composites before expanding to all 188 surfaces.
Verification: 108/108 masters opened cleanly; all 1024x1024 8-bit RGB 4-channel; 6 layers each; 0 smart objects in all 108; artwork layer measured 0/1048576 non-zero alpha pixels; colour variants measured at luminance correlation ~0.0 against the white master; coverage arithmetic 188 needed vs 94 canonical present. Composite renders committed for visual confirmation.
```

## Mockup rebuild decision (approved — staged implementation)

The previous chat attempted to build a PSD/PSB smart-object system. The audit
proved no such system exists in the assets. The owner has now approved:

  Rebuild genuine Smart Object masters from the existing source photos,
  cutouts, masks, and geometry assets, while using the same manifest to drive
  the local realtime browser compositor. Build representatives first, quarantine
  the full matrix, and promote to production only after all written gates pass.

The approved approach retains these constraints:
  - 94 of 188 canonical surfaces have no master at all (see audit §3).
  - Water bottle is hash-pinned and single-colour; the kit's 14 extra bottle
     colours are non-canonical and must not ship.
  - smart-v9 gate requires 188 surfaces, each visually accepted with real
     provenance. Copying smart-v4 into smart-v9 cannot pass it.
  - No fallback is permitted: partial shipping blocks release, by contract.

## Latest audit checkpoint

- Confirmed strengths: settings-driven commerce, multi-surface product catalog,
  high-fidelity photo mockups, 2D/3D Design Studio, draft autosave, product
  switching with print-zone refit, API caching/rate limits/CSRF protection,
  dynamic sitemap, and mobile loading/error states.
- Highest-priority findings: icon-only navigation controls need accessible names;
  mobile sticky actions need a shared stacking context; image dimensions need
  reserved layout space; 25% advance payment needs to be visible beside buying
  actions; the Design Studio needs a clearer guided workflow and quality gate;
  mobile checkout keyboard handling needs verification; production security
  must never expose development reset/bypass behavior.
- Visual direction recommended for approval: a premium "Dhaka Color Spectrum"
  system—warm white and ink foundations with controlled orange, indigo, teal,
  Bangladesh green, and violet accents—using multicolor for product/category
  meaning and moments of delight, not as uncontrolled decoration.
- Audit evidence: `audit/live-trynextshop-home.png`,
  `audit/live-trynextshop-products.png`, and
  `audit/live-trynextshop-design-studio.png`.

## Latest local follow-up pass (2026-09-01)

```text
Status: complete — external production rollout verified
Last completed: Added the Design Studio first-use guide and print-quality gate,
published the verified source release to GitHub main using a clean history, and
confirmed the active Render service deployed commit ca1c202. Cloudflare Pages
now routes to the Render primary. Production health reports DB healthy, Redis
healthy:primary, R2 storage, primary runtime, and scheduler enabled.
Stopped at: No runtime blocker remains for the approved CF Pages + Render +
Upstash scope. Cloudflare's management API token returns Invalid API Token, but
the GitHub-connected Pages deployment and live gateway are functioning.
Files/areas changed: Design Studio quality workflow and guidance, homepage image
layout, mobile checkout spacing, API/gateway reliability, deployment routing,
and operational handoff. Credential-bearing attachments, screenshots, PDFs, and
cache output were excluded from the release.
Remaining work: None for external production. The mockup master-layer decision
remains paused as documented below. Rotate CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN only if future
automated Cloudflare API administration is needed.
Blocker: None for live storefront/API traffic. Replit publishing is intentionally
out of scope. Do not copy credentials from attachments or re-add a retired
domain.
Next safe action: Monitor the active Render service and Pages gateway. Replace
only CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN through the secure Secrets UI before future Cloudflare
API management, if needed.
Verification: GitHub main is ca1c202; Render deploy
dep-dab1mv68bjmc7380ovk0 is live on that commit. Both Pages and Render returned
200 for healthz, liveness, readiness, products, settings, robots.txt, and
sitemap.xml. Invalid POST /api/orders returned the expected 400 validation
response without creating an order. Pages health reported runtimeRole=primary,
redis_detail=healthy:primary, and schedulerEnabled=true. Storefront tests (21
files, 71 tests), API tests (5 files, 20 tests), typechecks, workflow restart,
browser logs, and git diff --check passed. The artifact registry could not
capture a screenshot of the external Pages deployment.
```

## Latest external production verification (2026-09-01)

The external production rollout is complete for the approved Cloudflare Pages +
Render + Upstash scope. GitHub `main` is `ca1c202`; Render deploy
`dep-dab1mv68bjmc7380ovk0` is live on that commit; and the active service is
`trynext-lifestyle-main-render`. Cloudflare Pages now routes the gateway to the
Render primary, whose health reports `runtimeRole=primary`,
`redis_detail=healthy:primary`, and `schedulerEnabled=true`.

Both `https://trynext.pages.dev` and
`https://trynex-lifestyle-main-render.onrender.com` returned 200 for healthz,
liveness, readiness, products, settings, robots.txt, and sitemap.xml. Invalid
`POST /api/orders` returned the expected 400 validation response without creating
an order. The legacy Render service is suspended and is not routed.

The current Cloudflare management token returns `Invalid API Token`; this does
not affect the already-working GitHub-connected Pages deployment. Replit
publishing is intentionally out of scope for this project. The mockup
master-layer decision remains paused as documented below.

## Latest live health check (2026-08-29)

See `.agents/memory/live-health-check-2026-08-29.md` for evidence. Summary:
- `https://trynext.pages.dev/` is ONLINE and current with `main`
  (a95903b). Homepage, products, Design Studio, robots.txt, 404/SPA routing OK.
- API reads healthy via standby origin: health OK, DB `db:true` (~60ms),
  `/api/products` returns 70 products, `/api/public-stats` 78 orders.
- **Primary API origin is SUSPENDED** (`trynex-api.onrender.com` → Render
  "Service Suspended"). Because the gateway never failovers mutations, checkout
  and all writes are currently broken; admin/system health also hits the
  suspended primary. Owner must restore/replace the primary Render service or
  repoint CF Pages `API_ORIGINS`.
- **`/sitemap.xml` is not in `SAFE_PUBLIC_PREFIXES`**, so it cannot fail over —
  Google currently receives a suspended page for the sitemap (SEO regression).
- **`trynext.pages.dev` DNS is parked at Namecheap** (NS =
  `ns1/ns2.lander.d.parity.domains`; A = parking IPs; site shows a Namecheap
  parking page). Custom domain no longer points to Cloudflare Pages.
- `trynext-shop-pages.dev` does not resolve — the real hostname is
  `trynext.pages.dev`.
- CRITICAL_FINDINGS.md claims the proxy has no hardcoded Render fallback, but
  `functions/api/[[path]].ts` still sets `DEFAULT_ORIGIN = trynex-api.onrender.com`
  (and `_middleware.ts` line 272) — that stale claim caused this diagnosis to be
  missed.

## 4-Render main migration (2026-08-29 — gateway LIVE, promotion blocked on owner access)

Owner decision: the 4th Render service becomes the ACTUAL MAIN (sole write
authority); reads split round-robin across `trynext-api-standby-2` /
`trynext-api-standby-3`; Render 1 (`trynext-api`) is retired (still suspended).
Implemented and **merged** — PR #55 landed as `2985b5d`, all GitHub checks green
(CI build+typecheck+lint+audit, active-app verification, Cloudflare Pages build).

- `functions/gateway-config.ts` + rewritten `functions/api/[[path]].ts` (root AND
  artifacts copy, kept byte-identical): role-based multi-route gateway — writes/admin/AI
  → primary only; safe public reads → round-robin + failover + down-skip;
  `/sitemap.xml` is now a safe read (SEO fix); **no hardcoded Render origin
  anywhere**; fails closed with a truthful 503.
- `_middleware.ts`: stale `trynex-api.onrender.com` fallback removed.
- Gateway tests: 10/10 green — re-verified on 2026-08-29 in this sandbox by running
  `vitest run` against the copied `functions/api/gateway.test.ts` (deps installed with
  npm in a scratch dir, since the monorepo store is not provisioned here).
- `tools/render-orchestrate.sh`: Render API inventory/promote/deploy/verify.
- `.github/workflows/render-orchestrate.yml`: **could never be committed** — GitHub
  refuses workflow writes from the agent's App, so PR #55 shipped the script without
  its runner. The workflow body is now versioned at
  `tools/ci/render-orchestrate.workflow.yml` for the owner to paste into
  `.github/workflows/render-orchestrate.yml`.
- Docs: `docs/FOUR_RENDER_MULTI_ROUTE_CONTRACT_2026-08-29.md` now carries the full
  promotion runbook (Path A CI / Path B Render dashboard / Path C interim restore),
  the post-wiring verification checklist, and the rollback note.
- Known pre-existing noise: "Workers Builds: trynex-liestyle" fails on every PR
  (also #45/#54) — stale/typo'd CF Workers project, NOT the Pages deploy; ignore
  or clean up in CF dashboard.

### Live consequence of the unfinished promotion

Because `PRODUCTION_ORIGINS.primary` is empty and no `API_PRIMARY_ORIGIN` is set in
Cloudflare Pages, **every mutation is refused by design**: checkout/order placement,
admin login and settings, Spin & Win settlement, AI generation, and
`GET /api/admin/system/health` all answer `503 {"detail":"No primary API origin
configured"}`. Reads (`/api/products`, `/api/public-stats`, `/sitemap.xml`) work. This
is not a new outage — writes were already dead while `trynext-api` is suspended — but
the gateway now says so truthfully instead of leaking a dead host, and the fix is the
promotion, not a fallback.

Second consequence: both read origins are free-tier Render services, so a cold
visitor can still get a 503 while Render serves its "Application loading" spin-up
page (observed 2026-08-29 on `trynext-api-standby-2`). The gateway's 15 s down-skip
bounds it; a dedicated cold-start retry policy is an open idea, deliberately NOT
implemented without approval.

### Blocker (owner step, exactly one path required)

- **Path A** — add repo secret `RENDER_API_KEY`, then create
  `.github/workflows/render-orchestrate.yml` from
  `tools/ci/render-orchestrate.workflow.yml`. The agent then runs `apply=false`
  (inventory), confirms a 4th Trynext service actually exists and which workspace it is
  in, runs `apply=true` with an explicit `target`, and commits the returned primary URL.
- **Path B** — no CI and no key: the owner creates/copies the 4th Render service in the
  dashboard, sets `TRYNEXT_RUNTIME_ROLE=primary`, `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`,
  `BACKUP_SYNC_ENABLED=false`, deploys `main`, and gives the agent the public URL to
  commit. Exactly one service may hold the primary role at a time.
- **Path C** — interim: restore `trynext-api` and set
  `API_PRIMARY_ORIGIN=https://trynex-api.onrender.com` in Cloudflare Pages to bring
  writes back while A or B completes; clear it immediately after the promotion.

Unverified premise that all three paths inherit: no session has ever completed a Render
API inventory, and the 2026-08-20 keys returned HTTP 400, so the existence and naming of
a 4th Trynext service is still an assumption until the inventory (Path A step 3) or the
owner (Path B) confirms it. A 4th service inside the **same** workspace also adds no new
5 GB bandwidth allowance — see `docs/RESOURCE_QUOTA_AUDIT_2026-08-20.md`.

## Completed handoff setup

The project now contains a mandatory Agent operating protocol in `AGENTS.md`,
with a pointer from `replit.md`. It requires first-reading the project context,
preserving existing work, planning before edits, updating related before/after
paths together, safely coordinating parallel work, verifying results, and
updating this handoff before completion.

The strong startup command is now prominently included in `AGENTS.md`,
`AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `replit.md`. Replit Agent automatically reads
`replit.md`, so the command is available in the original project and in
copies/Remixes that include the project README.

This protocol is file-based and will be included when the project is copied or
Remixed. A Remix still starts a new private Agent conversation; the original
chat itself is not transferred. The durable context that has been written into
these project files is what the next Agent can read.

## Approved plans and decisions

The project owner has approved this handoff protocol:

- Future Agents must read the project context first.
- The exact default instruction must be treated as the first operating request
  in every new or Remixed Agent chat.
- Every new chat must clearly report where work was left off and what remains
  before proposing or starting implementation.
- User instructions and newer explicit decisions remain authoritative.
- Existing work must be preserved and related before/after paths updated together.
- Plans must be submitted before implementation.
- Independent parallel work is allowed only with clear boundaries and a final
  reconciliation.
- A completion or pause/blocked handoff summary and updated handoff are required
  before closing.

## Best startup command for the next Agent

> **START HERE — do not edit anything yet.** Read `AGENTS.md`,
> `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `replit.md` first. Then inspect the current project
> state and respond with these headings: **Completed**, **Last stopping point**,
> **Remaining work**, **Blockers**, **Plan**, **Existing behavior to preserve**,
> **Verification**, and **Safe parallel work**. Submit the plan before editing.
> Preserve all working features, update related before/after paths together,
> keep the handoff current while working, reconcile and verify parallel work,
> and finish with the exact **Status**, **Last completed**, **Stopped at**,
> **Files/areas changed**, **Remaining work**, **Blocker**, **Next safe action**,
> and **Verification** in `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`. If work stops early, provide the
> same handoff instead of leaving the next Agent to infer anything from chat.

## Runtime-role regeneration checkpoint (2026-09-06)

```text
Status: ready for review — local structural release verified
Last completed: Finished the pending Smart v10.3 runtime-role generation from the
  regenerated 188 PSD/source surfaces, promoted only the six reviewed PNG roles
  plus manifest into the public runtime tree, and repaired the release validator
  to accept the generator's intentional candidate staging status while keeping
  the release output structurally-verified.
Stopped at: After restarting both managed services and completing the local
  non-mutating verification pass.
Files/areas changed: tools/build-smartobject-mockups.mjs,
  tools/build-smartobject-runtime-roles.mjs,
  tools/validate-smartobject-release.mjs, the v10-v3 staging/runtime-role
  outputs, and the active public v10 runtime-role PNG/manifest tree.
Remaining work: Publish/commit this verified local continuation through the
  normal owner-controlled GitHub/hosting rollout if desired; do not mark visual
  approval from this checkpoint alone.
Blocker: None for local structural verification. Production/public rollout is a
  separate provider step and was not performed in this continuation.
Next safe action: Review or publish the verified runtime-role continuation, then
  repeat the non-mutating public canonical/retired-path checks after deployment.
Verification: Smart matrix 188/188; Smart Object release gate
  structurally-verified 188/188; public runtime matrix 188 surfaces and 1,128
  roles; protected roles non-empty; storefront typecheck passed; storefront
  tests passed (19 files/64 tests); storefront production build passed; API
  typecheck passed; proxied root, Design Studio, health, readiness, products,
  mockups, and settings routes returned 200; both managed workflows are
  running; desktop preview rendered without browser-console errors. No order,
  payment, or production data was changed.
```

## Full-canvas Smart Object compositor checkpoint (2026-09-07)

```text
Status: complete — shared runtime compositor implemented and locally verified
Last completed: Rewired the live Design Studio 3D viewer, mug wrap preview, and
  WebGL-less fallback to consume a full-canvas PSD-derived composite instead of
  an artwork-only texture. The shared order is studio background → base →
  artwork in the Smart Object print zone → shadow multiply → highlight screen →
  protected source-over. Protected runtime roles therefore remain above artwork,
  including hoodie drawstrings, hood seams, collars, cuffs, pockets, handles,
  and bottle hardware. The API renderer now uses the same order with protected
  as its final foreground pass.
Stopped at: After restarting the storefront workflow, capturing the Design
  Studio preview, and completing the final API/storefront validation pass.
Files/areas changed: artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/design-studio/composer.ts,
  ProductViewer3D.tsx, garment3d.tsx, composer.contract.test.ts,
  artifacts/api-server/src/routes/mockupRender.ts, and the approved design
  specification at docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-smart-object-runtime-
  compositor-design.md.
Remaining work: A browser-interaction upload proof with a non-empty design
  still needs to be performed if visual release approval requires testing a
  real uploaded image over the hoodie ropes. The screenshot tool could load the
  studio and confirm 6/6 roles, but the browser-use interaction binary was not
  available in this workspace to dismiss the onboarding guide or upload an
  artwork fixture. Provider deployment/GitHub promotion remains separate.
Blocker: None for implementation or local structural verification. Redis emits
  its existing optional-cache credential degradation while DB-backed API
  readiness remains healthy.
Next safe action: Perform the authenticated visual upload proof on the Design
  Studio, then review the same output in cart/export before any public rollout.
Verification: Storefront typecheck passed; storefront tests passed (19 files,
  65 tests); storefront production build passed; API typecheck passed; API tests
  passed (10 files, 36 tests); API build passed; both managed workflows are
  running; root and Design Studio previews rendered with no browser-console
  errors; Design Studio status card reported 6/6 runtime roles ready; and no
  order, payment, production data, or deployment state changed.
```

## Print-area selection controls checkpoint (2026-09-07)

```text
Status: complete — non-destructive print-area editing controls implemented
Last completed: Replaced the selected-image raw bitmap rectangle with a fixed
  active-face print-area frame. The frame dims the outside area, shows eight
  edge/corner scale handles and a rotation control, and keeps the source image
  draggable underneath the non-destructive print mask. Image layers use the
  print-area controls while text and shape layers retain their existing
  transformer behavior.
Stopped at: After restarting the storefront workflow and completing typecheck
  plus the storefront regression suite.
Files/areas changed: artifacts/trynex-storefront/src/pages/studio/CanvasArea.tsx,
  studio-regressions.test.ts, and the interaction specification at
  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-print-area-selection-design.md.
Remaining work: Perform a manual upload-and-select visual check on mobile and
  desktop, including hoodie, T-shirt, long sleeve, cap, mug, and bottle faces.
  The browser-use CLI is not installed in this workspace, so that interaction
  could not be automated in this continuation. The underlying product print
  zones and Smart Object compositor remain the source of truth.
Blocker: None for implementation. Only the authenticated browser interaction
  proof remains.
Next safe action: Upload a real artwork fixture in the Design Studio, confirm
  the fixed frame follows the active print zone, drag each handle, rotate, and
  verify live preview/export clipping before public rollout.
Verification: Storefront typecheck passed; storefront tests passed (19 files,
  66 tests); the storefront workflow restarted successfully; Design Studio
  route loaded at mobile size without browser-console errors; and no order,
  payment, production data, or deployment state changed.
```

## Final publication and verification checkpoint (2026-09-17)

```text
Status: complete — verified source published and live site updated
Last completed: Rebuilt and validated the temporary 188-surface Smart Object
  staging release, added portable real PSD/PSB parser fixtures, published the
  verified commit to GitHub main, and confirmed the Cloudflare Pages site
  updated from the pushed source.
Stopped at: After local workflow, test, build, GitHub Actions, live-domain,
  optimized-image, sitemap, API-health, and public runtime-manifest checks.
Files/areas changed: artifacts/api-server/src/lib/psdMasterParser.test.ts and
  its two real parser fixtures under artifacts/api-server/src/lib/fixtures/psd/.
  The rebuilt editable 188-surface source kit remains outside the public
  runtime and was not committed or exposed to the storefront.
Remaining work: Perform the deferred authenticated browser interaction review
  for Checkout, Account/messages, admin operations, and representative Design
  Studio upload/cart/export flows across desktop and mobile.
Blocker: The Cloudflare API token is active but cannot read this Pages account
  and returns 403 for the project endpoint. This did not block the rollout:
  GitHub push triggered successful CI and active-app verification, and the
  public site served the new optimized asset afterward. Local Redis remains an
  optional-cache degradation; database-backed API readiness is healthy.
Next safe action: Complete the authenticated browser review without creating
  orders or payment records, then record per-flow visual acceptance.
Verification: Smart Object release gate passed structurally-verified for
  188/188 surfaces; native ag-psd inspection found 188/188 1024x1024 documents,
  one embedded Smart Object each, and non-empty embedded payloads. Full
  workspace typecheck passed; API tests passed (10 files/36 tests); storefront
  tests passed (19 files/69 tests); storefront production build passed; mobile
  typecheck passed; both managed workflows restarted cleanly. GitHub CI and
  Active app verification succeeded for the published commit. Live checks:
  homepage 200, optimized WebP 200 image/webp, accepted 188-surface runtime
  manifest, API health 200, sitemap 200. The local screenshot rendered the
  homepage with no browser-console errors.
```
